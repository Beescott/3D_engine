This project was made to understand the ray-tracing algorithm and 3d geometry algorithm.
We chose to use OpenGL but only to display pixels on a window to not have to deal with windows terminal.

To launch the application, go in the "Executable" directory and launch the MoteurPhysique.exe file.
A scene will appear where you can see a cube, a sphere, a triangle and a book.

The book is an obj file containing only vertexs. Disabling it by pressing M will greatly improve the fps.

An anti-aliasing method might be implemented later.
